                        <p>EcoChange tracks users’ involvement in environmental tasks through “Quests”; sets of challenges to 
                          <br>get the user to contribute within the community. Daily quests consist of mini tasks which refresh 
                          <br>everyday, while Weekly quests are goals to complete throughout longer periods of time. The aim of the 
                          <br>quest system is to motivate the user to participate consistently in promoting and creating sustainability 
                          <br>for the environment. Examples of Weekly quests may include observing the growth of a plant throughout 
                          <br>each week, including Daily quests such as planting, watering, and taking care of the plant. Completing 
                          <br>quests will grant users ecocoins, a virtual currency that can be traded in for rewards such as gift cards. 
                          <br>Weekly quests give more ecocoins than Daily quests, encouraging users to complete long-term tasks that may 
                          <br>be more impactful and beneficial to the environment.
