                <p>Our EcoChange team is a group of high school students who are passionate about helping the environment and <br>combatting climate change. We strive to motivate others to start caring for the environment with the <br>EcoChange app, as well as popularizing sustainable lifestyles in communities. We were inspired to design <br>this app because of Joe, a high school student from the Philippines where climate change is extremely <br>severe. Read below more about his story and how the EcoChange team is working to support his community!

                        <p>Joe is a high school student from the Philippines where his hometown is at risk of facing extreme <br>weather conditions. Joe is aware that the rapidly increasing population in his area has had its <br>tolls,and is threatening the country’s vulnerability to climate change. Some of the trends that <br>have amplified the environmental crisis include waste and housing problems, deforestation, and <br>rising CO2 emissions.

                        <p>In 10-20 years, the consequences of climate change will become irreversible. Given that the <br>community has an increasing population, the contribution to global warming is higher than ever, <br>which also means more intense consequences. To minimize the catastrophes of climate change, it is <br>important to take advantage of the available large population. With the help of EcoChange, Joe’s <br>community is able to start improving their current situation by identifying the factors <br>amplifying climate change (waste production, deforestation, rising carbon emissions, etc) and <br>solving them one task at a time.
